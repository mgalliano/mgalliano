## Introduction
Hello! My name is **Madeline Galliano**. I am in the MESM program in the Earth & Hydrologic Science track. I also plan on recieving a Certificate in Hydrology and a Certificate in GIS. If all goes well, I hope to graduate at the end of this semester. 

### Background

I am originally from the East Bay Area of California. In 2015 I decided I needed a change of pace, so I randomly picked a place on a map and moved to North Carolina. I did not know anyone or have a job lined up. However, that is still one of the best decisions I ever made. I eventually graduated from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and recieved my bachelors in Environmental & Sustainability Studies with a minor in Biology and a minor in History. I had always dreamed of majoring in History up until I realized I probably couldn't get a job that wasn't _teaching_, which is why I switched gears. I have no interest in having a career in academia.

### Interests

Honestly, as of now, I do not have very many interests. I am pretty focused on trying to get a job. Now that my graduation date is creeping up, I am definitely stressing out more and more about my next steps. That has also been my problem with internships...many of the ones I have applied to want a longer commitment than I feel I am able to offer. So I am in this weird spot of wanting to have a job lined up, but feeling ~~imposter syndrome~~ unqualified. Ultimately, what I would like to do when I _grow_ up is help communities protect, secure, or gain freshwater resources; especially on an international level. How I do that? I don't know. Sure it would be nice to work for a NGO, but I don't know what that entails. Government is cool, but I know it is limited in very many aspects. Private is awesome in terms of pay, but morally? Anyway, I have student loans I need to pay off, so more money is ideal. Yet many of the private companies seem to be consulting firms and that doesn't sound fun especially if I have to worry about commission or keeping a client's budget down. 

If I was asked what I like to do though? I love to sleep. I can sleep like a teenager, past noon if I'm allowed. Aside from that, I do love being outdoors. When I lived in California and North Carolina, I loved hiking. North Carolina does not have any mountains compared to California though, so I always called them hills. Moving to Rhode Island though? There is not anything! Everyone tells me to go to New Hampshire or New York to hike. I have not had the time to do either. Lastly, I have been wanting to take up knitting. It is not a hobby that runs in my family, but I know it is good for dexterity and just looks cool. I have a starter kit but again, with time, we shall see when I start that. 

### Experience

My dad is proficient in AutoCad and now Revit (I think that's what the new one is called). Anyway, I was lucky enough to grow up with a parent who learned quite a bit about computers. I have had a few laptops and one of them had Malware, so I remember going through the command prompt on Windows and working through things that way. Aside from that I know nothing about coding. Additionally, I am not on any social media platforms except Reddit. Some may say I am a little paranoid about having my information out there and I do try to erase as much as I can from the internet (especially when it comes to my address and phone number, etc.). On Reddit, I am primarily a lurker and just enjoy the creativity from other people's comments because it sure can be entertaining! That being said I do have a familiarity with markdown styles. To illustrate this I will add a link and an image below, other than that, this concludes my introduction! I look forward to this course, thank you.
